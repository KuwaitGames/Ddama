# Ddama

Ddama is a game in which two players play the classic board Dama (aka [Turkish draughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_draughts), a variant of checkers) with a twist!

When one player eats an opponents piece, the attacker is thrown into a mini-game inspired by lunar lander, in which they need to land their piece safely or risk losing it from the board!
